Getting started
===============

To avoid dependency conflicts, we recommend the the use of a dedicated
`virtual <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/venv.html>`_ or `conda
<https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-
environments.html>`_ environment.  In a terminal run the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda create -n simfish_env python=3.6
   $ source activate simfish_env

We recommend two options to then install Sim-FISH in your virtual environment.
